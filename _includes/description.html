<h2><b>Hello, how are you?</b></h2> 

<p>My name is Kimberly Hopson and I'm a technical writer. Thanks for visiting my page!</p>

<p>With over 7 years in the documentation field, I bring a fair amount of experience and versatility to the table. I've dabbled in a variety of writing styles and formats, 
from technical editing and UI/UX writing to content marketing and API documentation. If you've got documentation-specific challenges such as creating a review process or 
managing repositories, no worries! I've jumped those hurdles before too.</p>

<p>I am currently a <b>technical writer</b> at Blackhawk Network. Previously, I've written for big players like Lucidworks, VMware, Johnson & Johnson, and Dell Boomi.
Whether you're looking for user-friendly instructions or reference documents that won't make your head spin, I've got you covered. Let's make your content shine!</p>
