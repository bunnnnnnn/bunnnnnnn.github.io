## Hi, how are you?

### My name is Kimberly Hopson and I'm a technical writer. Thanks for visiting my page!

I am a versatile writer with over 6 years of experience in software documentation. 
I also have experience with technical editing, UI/UX writing, content marketing,
and API documentation. 

I am currently a **Documentation Engineer* at Lucidworks. In the past, I've written stuff 
for companies such as VMware, Johnson & Johnson, and Dell Boomi.
