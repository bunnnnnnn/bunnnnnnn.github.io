My ideal work culture encourages creativity and collaboration, and provides plenty of opportunities for growth. I work best in environments that are psychologically safe and 
uphold a fair work-life balance. â€‹

I have a lot of random obsessions. I won't/can't list them all:

* [Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/)
* Reading (any genre, but mainly sci-fi)
* Coffee/home setups
* Gaming
* PC building
* One Wheeling/E-Unicycles
* Trying obscure snack foods
* Aerial sports
* Solar firestarters
* All things cute
